# Projects and Assignments by Howard Hsieh (410978002)

This repository gathers a series of projects from my coursework in Statistics and Python programming. The projects range from function plotting and numerical optimization to classification experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. They showcase my skills in data visualization, statistical estimation, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Homework 1 – Python Function Plotting

**Description:**  
This assignment focuses on mastering Python’s plotting capabilities by graphing 11 different functions. The work involves not only drawing the functions but also annotating key features such as local and global extrema, roots, asymptotes, and function ranges.

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- NumPy for generating function domains  
- Matplotlib for plotting with customized ticks, labels, colors, legends, and grids  
- Detailed discussions and annotations for each function

## Homework 2 – Advanced Plotting and Chi-Square Table

**Description:**  
In this homework, I explore more advanced plotting techniques. In one part, I use loops and matrix operations to generate rotated plots and concentric figures. In another part, I calculate chi-square right-tail areas for a range of degrees of freedom and export the resulting table to an Excel file.

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- Dynamic plot generation using loops (e.g., rotated shapes, markers)  
- Use of SciPy’s chi2 functions for statistical tables  
- Exporting data to Excel via Pandas

## Homework 3 – Classifier Comparison Experiments

**Description:**  
This project compares the performance of multiple classifiers (multinomial logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks) on a given dataset. The experiments include parameter tuning via grid search and cross-validation, along with detailed performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation  
- Cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning  
- Comparative analysis and discussion of classifier performance

## Mid Project – Monte Carlo Simulation for the Jarque-Bera Test

**Description:**  
This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to validate the distribution of the Jarque-Bera (JB) test statistic. By simulating samples from different populations (normal, t-distributions, uniform, chi-square, etc.), I evaluate the empirical distribution of skewness and kurtosis measures (and their combinations) and compare them to theoretical distributions.

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- Monte Carlo simulation with large numbers of replications  
- Calculation of skewness, kurtosis, and JB statistics  
- Visualization via histograms, empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), surface, and contour plots  
- Assessing test power under various population distributions

## Homework 5 – Univariate Function Root & Minimum Finding

**Description:**  
This assignment focuses on using numerical optimization methods to locate roots and local minima of univariate functions. The tasks include handling functions with discontinuities (e.g., asymptotes) and plotting the function along with markers indicating the optimum points.

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- SciPy’s optimization routines (e.g., minimize_scalar)  
- Function analysis and plotting with Matplotlib  
- Annotating plots with text and lines for clarity

## Final Project

**Description:**  
This project involves the estimation of parameters in a mixture of normal distributions and solving constrained optimization problems. In one exercise, I compare true and estimated probability density functions (pdf) for various parameter settings to observe when the mixture exhibits distinct bimodal features. In another, I derive and optimize a log-likelihood function under constraints.

**Key Tools & Concepts:**  
- Mixture models and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)  
- Numerical optimization using SciPy  
- Analysis and visualization of pdf curves
